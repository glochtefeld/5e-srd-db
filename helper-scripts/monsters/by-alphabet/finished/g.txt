Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)
Traits
Elemental Demise. If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.
Innate Spellcasting. The djinni’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave 3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind walk 1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift
Actions
Multiattack. The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.
Scimitar. MWA. +9 to hit, reach 5 Feet, 1 target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage | 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) thunder damage ? djinni’s choice.
Create Whirlwind. A 5-­‐foot-­‐radius, 30-­‐foot-­‐tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 Feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 Feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.  A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

Traits
Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 Feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
Actions
Withering Touch. MWA. +5 to hit, reach 5 Feet, 1 target. Hit: 17 (4d6+3) necrotic damage.
Etherealness. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
Horrifying Visage. Each non-­‐undead creature within 60 Feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.  If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 Feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.  The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 Feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
