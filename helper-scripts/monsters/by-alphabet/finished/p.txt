If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 Feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 Feet of movement, exiting prone.
Tail Stinger. MWA. +9 to hit, reach 10 Feet, 1 creature. Hit: 19 (3d6+9) piercing damage & the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
