Skills Stealth +3
Senses blindsight 60 Feet
Challenge 1/2 (100 XP)
Traits
Echolocation. The darkmantle can’t use its blindsight while deafened.
False Appearance. While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.
Actions
Crush. MWA. +5 to hit, reach 5 Feet, 1 creature. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.  While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.  A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 Feet of movement.
Darkness Aura (1/Day). A 15-­‐foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-­‐foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.

The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

Traits
Shapechanger. The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 Feet), a raven (20 Feet, fly 60 Feet), or a spider (20 Feet, climb 20 Feet), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Devil’s Sight. Magical darkness doesn’t impede the imp’s darkvision.
Magic Resistance. The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Invisibility. The imp magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it.
