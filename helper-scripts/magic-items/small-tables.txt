Deck of Many Things Card Effects
Balance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration,
causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes
chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are
true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on
you.
Comet. If you single-­‐‑handedly defeat the next
hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter,
you gain experience points enough to gain one level.
Otherwise, this card has no effect.
Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a
state of suspended animation in an extradimensional
sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying
stays behind in the space you occupied when you
disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are
found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be
located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can
reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more
cards.
Euryale. The card’s medusa-­‐‑like visage curses you.
You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed
in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates
card can end this curse.
The Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins
anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if
it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as
soon as you draw the card or at any other time
before you die.
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.
The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life,
savoring your suffering before attempting to slay
you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil
dies.
Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and
draw from the deck again, counting both draws as
one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP
would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an
amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep
your level.
Gem. Twenty-­‐‑five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000
gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at
your feet.
Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by
1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one
additional card beyond your declared draws.
Jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two
additional cards beyond your declared draws.
Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you
are proficient appears in your hands. The GM
chooses the weapon.
Knight. You gain the service of a 4th-­‐‑level fighter
who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of
you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves
you loyally until death, believing the fates have
drawn him or her to you. You control this character.
Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish
spell 1d3 times.
Rogue. A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice
becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your
new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone
else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or
divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility
toward you.
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own,
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least.
Any documentation that proves you should own
something lost to this card also disappears.
Skull. You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly
humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and
carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of
the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you,
warning all others that you must win the battle alone.
The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit
points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to
help you, the helper summons its own avatar of
death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be
restored to life.
Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The
score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.
Sun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item
(which the GM determines randomly) appears in
your hands.
Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t
destroyed but do vanish.
Throne. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion
skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on
checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain
rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the
world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of
monsters, which you must clear out before you can
claim the keep as yours.
Vizier. At any time you choose within one year of
drawing this card, you can ask a question in
meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to
that question. Besides information, the answer helps
you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In
other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on
how to apply it.
The Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul
is drawn from your body and contained in an object
in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful
beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in
this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell
can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the
location of the object that holds it. You draw no more
cards.

Efreeti Bottle d100 Effect
01–10
The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle
loses its magic.
11–90
The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you
command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,
and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t
be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the
bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the
bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti
escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its
magic.
91–00
The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for
you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or
after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.

Feather token effects
Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token
to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel
can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to
the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends,
the token disappears.
Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet
into the air. The token disappears and an enormous,
multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the
statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple
commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500
pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles
an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a
one-­‐‑hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000
pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after
flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to
0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.
Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an
action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The
token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its
place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong
enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its
speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can
dismiss the fan as an action.
Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the
token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter.
The token disappears, and a 50-­‐‑foot-­‐‑long, 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑
wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The
boat is self-­‐‑propelled and moves across water at a
speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action
while on the boat to command it to move or to turn
up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-­‐‑two
Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature
counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge
creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24
hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat
as an action.
Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You
can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space
on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place
a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The
tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter trunk,
and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-­‐‑foot
radius.
Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to
a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears,
and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use
a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a
creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack
bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force
damage.  
As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the
whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack
against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip
disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to
dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.

believing something awesome just happened.

Heavy rain falls in a 60-­‐foot radius centered on
the target. The area becomes lightly obscured.
The rain falls until the start of your next turn.
34–36
An animal appears in the unoccupied space
nearest the target. The animal isn’t under your
control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100
to determine which animal appears. On a 01–25,
a rhinoceros appears; on a 26–50, an elephant
appears; and on a 51–100, a rat appears.
37–46
You cast lightning bolt.
47–49
A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-­‐foot
radius centered on the target. The area becomes
heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10
minutes.
50–53
You enlarge the target as if you had cast
enlarge/reduce. If the target can’t be affected by
that spell, or if you didn’t target a creature, you
become the target.
54–58
You cast darkness.
59–62
Grass grows on the ground in a 60-­‐foot radius
centered on the target. If grass is already there,
it grows to ten times its normal size and remains
overgrown for 1 minute.
63–65
An object of the GM’s choice disappears into the
Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn
nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no
larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
66–69
You shrink yourself as if you had cast
enlarge/reduce on yourself.
70–79
You cast fireball.
80–84
You cast invisibility on yourself.
85–87
Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point
in space as the target, leaves sprout from the
creature nearest to that point. Unless they are
picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off
after 24 hours.
88–90
A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp,
shoots from the wand’s tip in a line 30 feet long
and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning
damage, and the total damage of the gems is
divided equally among all creatures in the line.
91–95
A burst of colorful shimmering light extends
from you in a 30-­‐foot radius. You and each
creature in the area that can see must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become
blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
96–97
The target’s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days.
If you chose a point in space, the creature
nearest to that point is affected.
98–00
If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. If you didn’t target a
creature, you become the target and must make
the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or
more, the target is instantly petrified. On any
other failed save, the target is restrained and
begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this
way, the target must repeat the saving throw at
the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a
failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the target is freed by the
greater restoration spell or similar magic.

Special Purpose
1
Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a
diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is
never neutral.)
2
Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of
a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,
or wizards.
3
Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular race
or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.
4
Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or
destroy the servants of a particular deity.
5
Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and
interests of a particular deity.
6
Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its
user to fight arbitrarily.
7
Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest
magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a
famous or notorious figure.
8
Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or
unravel a cryptic prophecy.
9
Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its
wielder have key roles to play in future events.
10
Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants
to understand why it was created.

Conflict
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its
personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a
manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose,
conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the
item makes a Charisma check contested by the
wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the
contest, it makes one or more of the following
demands:
• The item insists on being carried or worn at all
times.
• The item demands that its wielder dispose of
anything the item finds repugnant.
• The item demands that its wielder pursue the
item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
• The item demands to be given to someone else.
If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s
wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:
• Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
• Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
• Attempt to take control of its wielder.
If a sentient item attempts to take control of its
wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving
throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma
modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by
the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder
must try to follow the item’s commands. If the
wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt
to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t
use this power again until the next dawn.
